description: '[This paper proposes] Neural Additive Models (NAMs) which combine some of
the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent intelligibility of generalized additive
models. NAMs learn a linear combination of neural networks that each attend to a
single input feature. These networks are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily
complex relationships between their input feature and the output. Our experiments
on regression and classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than
widely used intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision
trees. They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive
models in accuracy, but can be more easily applied to real-world problems.'
