    My name is Ryan Saxe, and I'm a Senior Machine Learning Research Scientist at PepsiCo.
    
    Prior to working at PepsiCo, I was in graduate school at The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. My research focused on classification of physiological and psychological pathologies via data corresponding to gait.
    
    When I'm not working on something Machine Learning related, you can find me dancing on the streets of New York City, or traveling the world to play Magic: the Gathering!
