    When I'm not working on something machine Learning related, you can find me dancing on the streets of New York City, or traveling the world to play Magic: the Gathering!   
  
    Many of my personal projects are at the intersection of my hobbies. One project is an AI for drafting MTG. I used this algorithm to achieve a high rank (#27 in the world)! This is, as far as I am aware, the first case of AI successfuly competing in MTG. You can view the code in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RyanSaxe/mtg">this github repository</a>.

            My main contributions were an internal API for training deep learning systems with economic priors, which has been used for optimizing marketing spend and determining price elasticity. 
            I also designed a multi-modal Graph Embedding model capable of measuring product similarity, which has been integrated with multiple models to help account for product cannibalization.
