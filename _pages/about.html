    My name is Ryan Saxe, and I'm a Senior Machine Learning Research Scientist at PepsiCo.

    I am currently most interested in embeddings. You might call me a latent space invader. 
        
    When I'm not working on something Machine Learning related, you can find me dancing on the streets of New York City, or traveling the world to play Magic: the Gathering!   
  
    Lastly, the intersection of my hobbies and machine learning is where my personal projects lie. One such example is an AI for drafting MTG. This AI is, as far as I am aware, the first case of AI successfuly competing in MTG. The details of the data, algorithm, and interpretations can be found in <a target="_blank" href="https://draftsim.com/ryan-saxe-bot-model/">this blog post</a>.

            I am currently researching the following topics:
            <p style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px !important">1. Regularizing parameter topologies for learning dense representations</p>
            <p style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px !important">2. Bayesian Neural Networks applied to Mixed Media Marketing</p>
            <p style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px !important">3. Designing and explaining transparent neural architectures</p>

            During this time, I made three major contributions:
            <p style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px !important">1. Built an internal API for training deep learning systems with economic priors</p>
            <p style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px !important">2. Used this API to optimize marketing spend and determine optimal price points</p>
            <p style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px !important">3. Designed a multi-modal Graph Embedding model capable of measuring product similarity</p>

            My area of research focus was Machine Vision applications for Gait Recognition and Classification of Pathological Disorders. I pursued this research at the RiskEcon Lab for Decision Metrics, and published this corresponding <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14465.pdf">survey paper</a>.
