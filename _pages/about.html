    My name is Ryan Saxe, and I'm a Senior Machine Learning Research Scientist at PepsiCo.
    
    Prior to working at PepsiCo, I was in graduate school at The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. My research focused on classification of physiological and psychological pathologies via data corresponding to gait.
    
    When I'm not working on something Machine Learning related, you can find me dancing on the streets of New York City, or traveling the world to play Magic: the Gathering!

            I am currently researching the following topics:
            <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px">1. Regularizing parameter topologies for learning dense representations</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px">2. Bayesian Neural Networks applied to Mixed Media Marketing</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px">3. Designing and explaining transparent neural architectures</p>

            During this time, I made three major contributions:
            <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px">1. Built an internal API on top of TensorFlow for training deep learning systems with economic priors</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px">2. I used this API to train models that optimize marketing spend and determine optimal price points</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px">3. Designed a multi-modal Graph Embedding model capable of measuring product similarity</p>

            My area of research focus was Machine Vision applications for Gait Recognition and Classification of Pathological Disorders. I pursued this research at the RiskEcon Lab for Decision Metrics, and published this corresponding <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14465.pdf">survey paper</a>.
